hdf2csv
=======

This bundled script will convert an Xspress 3 hdf5 file into a series of csvs, one per frame

.. code-block:: bash

    [#] hdf2csv.py
    usage: hdf2csv.py [-h] file
    hdf2csv.py: error: too few arguments


The outputted csvs have the same format as the Xspress 3 Calibration software so can be dropped into
